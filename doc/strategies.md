## RL
- [Personae](https://github.com/Ceruleanacg/Personae) : RL & SL Methods and Envs For Quantitative Trading
Personae is a repo that implements papers proposed methods in Deep Reinforcement Learning and supervised Learning and applies them to the Financial Market.
- [Gym-trade](https://github.com/hackthemarket/gym-trading): Environment for reinforcement-learning algorithmic trading models.
The Trading Environment provides an environment for single-instrument trading using historical bar data.
- [SGX-Full-OrderBook-Tick-Data-Trading-Strategy](https://github.com/rorysroes/SGX-Full-OrderBook-Tick-Data-Trading-Strategy): Providing the solutions for high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies using data science approaches (Machine Learning) on Full Orderbook Tick Data.
- [HFT_Bitcoin](https://nbviewer.org/github/ghgr/HFT_Bitcoin/blob/master/hftbitcoin.ipynb): Analysis of High Frequency Trading on Bitcoin exchanges
- [LSTM Crypto Price Prediction](https://github.com/SC4RECOIN/LSTM-Crypto-Price-Prediction): Predicting the price trend of Bitcoin using an lstm-RNN. Technical analysis is applied to historical BTC data in attempt to extract price action for automated trading. 
- [Reinforcement-Learning-based-Trading-Strategy](https://github.com/harendrasainath/Reinforcement-Learning-based-Trading-Strategy): The algorithm takes an action (buy, sell or hold) depending upon the current state of the stock price. The algorithm is trained using Deep Q-Learning framework, to help us predict the best action, based on the current stock prices.
